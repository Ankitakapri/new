# Networking-Troubleshooting-tool
My project is a Networking Troubleshooting Tool designed to simplify common network diagnostic tasks. This user-friendly application features a graphical interface that enables users to perform essential network checks without manually entering commands.

With this tool, users can:
Check network connectivity using a ping test
Analyze network routes with traceroute
Scan open ports on a system
Calculate subnet details
Convert domain names to IP addresses
By integrating multiple networking utilities into a single application, this tool makes it easier to diagnose and resolve network issues efficiently.

The project is built using Python, utilizing libraries such as socket, os, and tkinter for functionality and interface design. It also incorporates threading to enhance the performance of tasks like port scanning. Additionally, all results are logged for future reference, providing users with a history of their network diagnostics.

The primary goal of this project is to offer a simple yet powerful solution for network administrators and general users, especially those who may not be familiar with complex networking commands but need to troubleshoot network issues quickly and effectively.
